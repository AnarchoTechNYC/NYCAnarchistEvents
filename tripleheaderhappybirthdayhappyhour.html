        <p>(<a href="/static/TRIPLE%20HEADER%20HAPPY%20BIRTHDAY%20HAPPY%20HOUR.ics">DOWNLOAD THIS EVENT TO YOUR CALENDAR</a>!)</p>

        <p>Hi, friends! Pride Month has come and gone but there's one more (massive) celebration to be had!</p>

        <p>Join me, your friendly neighborhood trans hacker party princess, for a TRIPLE HEADER HAPPY HOUR event: the company I work for tapped me to organize a "How was your pride?" post-pride month Happy Hour, and I'm combining it with my birthday party and the next Killer Queen Open Hive Night at Wonderville.</p>

        <p>The ‚ÄúHow was your Pride?‚Äù Happy Hour is for my co-workers in NYC, and I'm inviting them all to combine forces with the NYC Killer Queen scene for their weekly Open Hive Night. That day is also my birthday celebration, so all three events are happening in the same place at the same time, all in one amazing evening!</p>

        <p>Join me and other colleagues (LGBTQ+ and allies) on Tuesday, July 5th, 5PM through 9PM at Wonderville in the center of the queer universe, my home base of Bushwick in Brooklyn. That Tuesday, come learn how to play the popular 10-player strategy arcade game "Killer Queen" from some of NYC‚Äôs best players and NYC's newest Queen Bee, yours truly! Come also to share Pride Month stories, meet one another in physical space, and meet more queer NYC locals. And of course, also come thru to wish me a happy birthday! üéÇ</p>

        <p>WHO: You, and hopefully many of your friends that you'll bring</p>

        <p>Join Vi and her work colleagues for a sponsored post-Pride Month "How was your Pride?" Happy Hour. Come meet other queers and allies from her work, their friends, and more of Vi's friends as we share our Pride Month stories and meet new folks who are gearing up for the sequel of "Hot Vaxxx Summer," "Hot Vaxxx Summer 2: I Wanna Know What You Did Last Pride!"</p>

        <p>This event is not exclusive to Vi's LGBTQ+ coworkers so everyone is welcome but (obviously?) is focused on making sure we create a space for LGBTQ+ employees with support from our allies. There will also be a limited open tab courtesy the company Employee Resource Group and employee experience team for this happy hour as well.</p>
     
        <p>VI'S HAPPY BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION:<br />
        5pm-2:30am</p>

        <p>It's my birthday! I'll be 1 year old, as my HRT anniversary is right around the corner! Come wish me a happy birthday at one of my favorite venues in all of New York City, and where I'm going to be anyway, Wonderville! Don't worry about bringing a gift or anything like that, just bring your amazing self and be ready for a "world's collide" moment because I'm inviting my co-workers (who know me by a different name and <em>everything</em>) so let's see how that goes, lol?</p>

        <p>You'll get to see a glimpse of me as the corporate!Vi version of myself, and they'll get to see a glimpse of the trans hacker party princess!Vi version of me! It'll be great! Or a complete disaster that will fuck up my life forever! I'm ready for either!</p>

        <p>KILLER QUEEN OPEN HIVE NIGHT:<br />
        8pm-12am</p>
